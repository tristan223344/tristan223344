         <h2>My opinion of the game</h2>
         <h3>my opinion on the game is that it is a good game overall but,<br>
         it has some bugs and glitches. for instance sometimes when you try to load<br>
         the game gets stuck on the loading screen. although the game is in a<br>
         somewhat late-stage and the bugs and glitches are not getting any better.<br>
         On the positive side of the game, it overall is a 9/10 in my opinion due<br>
         the fact that Visual Concepts one of the creators of the game does listen to<br>
         the community and change and fix some of the glitches that make the game<br>
         near to unplayable. With 2k23 soon to be out, I would hope that these glitches are fixed.<br>
         after all the game does have a place where you can leave a comment or get help, but it <br>
         takes anywhere between 1-3 weeks to even get your message noticed.<br>
